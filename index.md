## Welcome to Robotic Imaging Readng Group

This page keeps track of the on-going imaging reading group activities. You will be able to find the schedule of the upcoming reading sessions, past presentations, related articles and a curated list of resources on imaging.

The meetings are held every Friday between 14:00 - 15:00 in hybrid mode: in-person at J04 conference room, Rose Street Building, Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR), The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia and via Zoom. If you like to join Robotic Imaging Reading Group, feel free to contact us.
